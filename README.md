# QRCode on Augmented Reality

## Introduction

The aim of this Android Application is to show in Augmented Reality, using a Google Cardboard, a 3d model on a Placeholder.

You can save your 3d-models in your Dropbox account, and store the link in a QR-Code. Once did that, the app automatically will download the model and show them in Augmented Reality.

The paper is in Italian. I won't translate it in English since Metaio is not available anymore to the public.
